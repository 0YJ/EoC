## Welcome to MPTSP Homepage
To eliminate biases from the observer in the conventional phenotyping progress with machine learning method, we present a comprehensive manually labeled dataset with 25 classes on 60k images by constructing a unique multi-pose multi-angle camera system, phenotyper v1.0, in order to collect high-quality digital images for fast processing of solanum lycopersicum (tomato) data in different life cycles. Using distributed models, we firstly used 5 classes to locate the region of interest, then generated 20 sub-classes based on  pixel-wise semantic segmentation for different computer vision tasks.
