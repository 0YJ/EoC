To eliminate biases from the observer in the conventional phenotyping progress with machine learning method, predicting the growth status of tomato plants in green house, we present a comprehensive manually labeled dataset with 25 classes on 60k images by constructing a unique multi-pose multi-angle camera system, "Eye of Demeter" v1.0, in order to collect high-quality digital images for fast processing of solanum lycopersicum (tomato) data in different life cycles. Using distributed models, we firstly used 5 classes to locate the region of interest, then generated 20 find-grained sub-classes based on pixel-wise semantic segmentation. We want to encourage researchers to not only work on basic detection and classification tasks, but also improving the performance by distrubuted models on different edges (drone, robotic, embedded system, etc) based on artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) strategy.
